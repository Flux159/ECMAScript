## JavaScript language binding for godot game engine

This module implements the ECMAScript 5.1 script language support for godot game engine.

[Duktape 2.3](https://duktape.org/) is used as the ECMAScript engine. It is possible to replace it with other JIT-supported engine but not in the near plan. 

**This project is still in development so it may contain bugs.**

The documentation is lacking because of my poor English skill. Contributions to documentation are welcomed!
